# SNCD_P1_Lane_Finding
Lane Finding mini project

This project aims at detecting highway lanes on the ground as a component for an autonomous driving solution. 
The processing is single image based, no history is used between frames, hence its current limitation.

The project runs on python using opencv frontend.
